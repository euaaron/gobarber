GoBarber is a project made during the GoStack Bootcamp provided by Rocketseat.
It was made originally on a branch of another repo where I store everything that I'm doing during the bootcamp, but now I decided to make a single repo for each GoBarber part like I would do with a professional project.

More info soon.
